# Pine roadmap

Feature checklist from the "what AWX is missing" brainstorm.
Status: ✅ done · 🚧 in progress · ⏳ planned · 🔗 blocked by another phase

## Quick wins (engine already exists)

- [x] ✅ **1. Variable lineage** — "where does this value come from?":
      full precedence chain per host × variable (role default → group_vars
      parents-first → host_vars → magic), shown in the inventory host panel.
      `GET /api/repos/{id}/lineage?inventory=…&host=…`
- [x] ✅ **2. Dead-code detection** — unused roles, never-notified handlers,
      unused vars (best effort), hosts targeted by no playbook.
      Part of `GET /api/repos/{id}/hygiene`, "Hygiene" page.
- [x] ✅ **3. Run diff** — compare two jobs of the same playbook: per
      task × host status transitions (ok→changed, ok→failed, new/removed
      tasks). `GET /api/jobs/{id}/diff?with=…`, view in job detail.

## Strong differentiators

- [x] ✅ **4. Blast radius on git diff** — changed files → impacted roles →
      playbooks → hosts → handlers. `GET /api/repos/{id}/impact?base=…&head=…`,
      "Impact" page + `pine impact` CLI for CI.
- [x] ✅ **5. Continuous drift detection** — drift heatmap playbooks × hosts
      computed from the latest `--check` job per playbook ("changed" under
      check = reality diverges). `GET /api/repos/{id}/drift`,
      `POST …/drift/check`, "Drift" page.
- [x] ✅ **6. Plan-gated schedules** — recurring runs (interval-based) that
      refuse to execute when the current plan fingerprint differs from the
      approved one; approve to resume. `/api/schedules` CRUD + approve +
      run-now, "Schedules" page.
- [x] ✅ **7. Light pipelines** — chained playbooks with stop-on-failure
      (or continue), canary steps via --limit, and manual approval gates
      (waiting_approval → approve & continue). `/api/pipelines` +
      `/api/pipeline-runs`, "Pipelines" page.
- [x] ✅ **8. Estimated duration in plans** — record real per-task durations
      from job logs, surface `≈ Xmin` on plans and slowest-task insights.

## Fun / demo

- [x] ✅ **9. Topology time-lapse** — replay the repo's git history and
      animate the inventory topology commit by commit (deduplicated frames).
      `GET /api/repos/{id}/timelapse`, player on the Topology page.
- [ ] ⏳ **10. Web SSH console** — per-host terminal in the browser
      (the TUI already has `s`); xterm.js + websocket, vendored.
      *Deliberately last: needs real SSH targets to validate.*
- [x] ✅ **11. Secrets hygiene** — plaintext password-like values in vars,
      vault usage inventory. Part of the hygiene report.

## Earlier milestones (done)

- [x] ✅ Multi-repo + recursive scanning + per-repo scan paths
- [x] ✅ Smart inventory discovery (INI/YAML/extension-less, merged dirs)
- [x] ✅ Constructed-inventory emulation with badges
- [x] ✅ Plan mode phases 1–2 (tri-state eval, missing vars, fact profiles,
      what-if topology, web/TUI/CLI surfaces)
- [x] ✅ Plan mode phase 3 — fact harvesting ("[gather facts]" jobs via
      `ansible -m setup --tree` or simulated; facts feed plans, lineage
      and schedule fingerprints)
- [x] ✅ Plan mode phase 4 — exact mode via `ansible-playbook --check`
      with the JSON callback, rendered in the plan UI as mode "exact"
- [x] ✅ `pine attach` — terminal UI over the daemon's HTTP API, so a
      systemd/Docker instance can be driven from a shell without opening a
      second engine on the single-writer store (`pine tui` warns on conflict)
- [x] ✅ `pine service install|status|uninstall` — manage a systemd user unit
      for the daemon (auto-restart, optional linger) straight from the CLI
- [x] ✅ TUI auto-refresh — re-syncs connected repos on load and periodically,
      announcing what changed in the status bar
- [x] ✅ Service status — hosts × services heatmap from the `services:` var,
      real running/stopped state via ansible `service_facts` (tri-state, honest
      `unknown`/`estimated`), plus status pills on inventory hosts
- [x] ✅ Git worktrees — list the working trees of a connected repo (main +
      linked, branch/HEAD, locked/prunable flags) under each repo on the
      Repositories page, with one-click **switch** to open a worktree's branch
      as the active repo; also the CLI (`pine worktrees`) and the REST API
      (`GET /api/repos/{id}/worktrees`)
- [x] ✅ Grouped playbook browser — playbooks listed as compact rows grouped
      by project (directory), with a live filter over name/path/host/tag and
      click-to-filter host & tag chips (replaces the old tile grid)
- [x] ✅ Inline `import_tasks` — static `import_tasks` are resolved at scan time
      (recursively, with cycle protection) and pulled into the playbook task-flow
      visualization in place; dynamic `include_tasks` stay a clickable reference
- [x] ✅ `pine lineage --playbook` — resolve a playbook's effective variables per
      host (expanding `import_tasks`/`import_playbook` and applying `include_vars`
      in Ansible order), in the same JSON/lineage shape with `include_vars`
      provenance; surfaces per-service config (e.g. `dedicated.yaml`) that plain
      inventory lineage misses. The web resolver picks up `include_vars` too.
- [x] ✅ Inline variable resolution — `{{ vars }}` in task names/args are resolved
      in the task-flow (and Plan args), host-agnostically by default with a
      "resolve as" host picker; each variable links to its lineage, unresolved
      vars stay raw, secrets are redacted (`GET /api/repos/{id}/resolve`).
      Covers role `vars/main.yml`, `include_role`/`import_role` roles (not just
      role defaults + the `roles:` list), `vars_prompt` defaults, and
      `{{ playbook_dir }}`-templated `vars_files`; nested values are expanded
      (`{{ monitoring_dir }}/alloy` → the composed path, facts left intact);
      `{{ item }}` in a loop shows the
      possible items instead of the placeholder. Unresolved vars are triaged
      runtime / defined-elsewhere / **defined-nowhere** (red); each play box has a
      **Variables panel docked beside its tasks** listing every variable it uses
      (resolved + unresolved, names coloured by state, with a colour legend, a
      "defined nowhere" count and an **All / Used-here filter**) with lineage; the
      panel is **resizable** (drag handle) and docked beside the tasks; the
      "resolve as" host picker (hosts the playbook **targets** via its `hosts:`
      pattern are grouped first; hosts with variable variation flagged); notify
      chips are **click-to-scroll** to their handler
      **highlights hosts that override a variable the playbook uses**
- [x] ✅ Syntax-highlighted source preview — the raw-file / "View YAML" pane
      highlights YAML and INI (keys, strings, numbers, booleans, comments,
      `{{ jinja }}`) with a tiny dependency-free tokenizer (no build, no CDN)
- [x] ✅ Plan variable resolution — the estimated plan resolves `vars_prompt`
      variables (their default, or a value provided in the run/plan modal),
      expands nested `{{ var }}` references, and follows `include_vars` — so task
      names/args/conditions template as they would at run time (e.g. a prompted
      `docker_path` no longer shows raw). vars_prompt fields are surfaced in the
      run/plan modal.
- [x] ✅ Vault-aware plans & runs — vault-encrypted variables the playbook uses
      are detected and listed (in the modal and the plan view); providing the
      ansible-vault password decrypts them for that plan via the ansible-vault
      CLI (transient, never stored). Undecrypted vault values are masked
      (`***vault***`) so raw blobs never leak into resolved names/args.
      `GET /resolve` and the plan report expose `vault_vars`. **Apply (run)**
      carries the password through to `ansible-playbook --vault-password-file`
      (and the resolved vars_prompt/extra vars via `-e @file`), all written to
      temp files removed after the run and never persisted to the job.
- [x] ✅ Click-to-open source files — a task that reads a local file/template
      (`template`/`copy`/`unarchive`/`assemble`/`script`) gets an **open** link
      on its `src:`; a `{{ templated }}` src is resolved against the current vars
      first, so it points at the real file (tried in templates/ or files/), shown
      in the highlighted preview. `import_tasks`/`include_*` paths were already
      clickable
